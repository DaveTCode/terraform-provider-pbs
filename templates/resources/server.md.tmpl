  Manage PBS server configuration. This resource is intended for import and updates of an existing server. Destroy removes from Terraform state only.

# pbs_server (Resource)

The PBS server is a singleton that already exists in your environment. This resource is designed to:

- Import the existing server into Terraform state
- Update server attributes via Terraform
- Be read using the `pbs_server` data source
- Delete behavior: destroying this resource removes it from Terraform state only; it does not delete the PBS server

## Example Usage

{{- if .HasExample }}
{{ .ExampleFile -}}
{{- else }}
```hcl
resource "pbs_server" "this" {
  name      = "pbs"
  acl_users = "admin,staff"
}
```
{{- end }}

### Delete behavior

- Removing the resource from configuration or running `terraform destroy` will only remove it from Terraform state.
- The PBS server is not deleted by this resource.

## Import

Import the existing server into state (replace "pbs" with your server's name):

```shell
terraform import pbs_server.this pbs
```
